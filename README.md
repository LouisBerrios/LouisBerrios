<h3 align="left">Scienctific Background: 
  
- 👨‍🔬 I'm a microbial ecologist with training in bacteriology, molecular genetics, mycology, and plant-microbe interactions. I received my PhD from the `University of South Carolina` in August 2021 and began my postdoctoral fellowship at `Stanford University` in October of 2021.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **small- and large-scale approaches to assess bacteria-fungi-plant interactions.**

<h3 align="left">Why Study Plant-Microbe Interactions?</h3> 

Terrestrial plants and microbes have been coevolving for `over 100 million years`, and their interactions contribute to `biogeochemical cycles` and `agricultural fecundity`. Two of the most `dominant and impactful` microbial groups are `bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi`, which often `benefit their plant host(s)`. Without these beneficial microbes, plants would be severely limited in their ability to survive and reproduce in nature. However, detailed `mechanisms` explaining many beneficial plant-microbe interactions remain unclear. Therefore, my research program [combines field and lab experiments](https://www.louisberrios.org/research) to uncover the `mechanisms` that drive `positive relationships` among `plants`, `bacteria`, and `mycorrhizal fungi`.

<h3 align="left">Using Genomics to Understand Plant-Microbe Interactions!</h3>

My past research has used [genomics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-020-04472-w) and [functional genetics](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249227) approaches to demonstrate the genotypic specificity of plant-microbe inteactions. Likewise, I have used [comparative genomics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00203-022-02953-3) to (1) demonstrate the genomic overlap(s) and dissimilarities between plant and human-associated bacteria and (2) [highlight genomic loci](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00203-021-02702-y) that may drive bacteria-plant relationships. My research will continue to use -omics approaches to understand how plants and microbes interact.

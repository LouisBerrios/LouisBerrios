<h3 align="left">I'm a microbial ecologist with training in bacteriology, molecular genetics, mycology, and plant-microbe interactions. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **small- and large-scale approaches to assess bacteria-fungi-plants interactions.**

- ðŸ’¬ Let's chat about **`bacteria-fungi-plant interactions`**, **`next-generation sequencing`**, and/or **`comparative genomics`**.

<h3 align="left">Why study plant-microbe interactions?</h3> 

Terrestrial plants and microbes have been coevolving for `over 100 million years`, and their interactions contribute to `biogeochemical cycles` and `agricultural fecundity`. Two of the most `dominant and impactful` microbial groups are `bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi`, which often `benefit their plant host(s)`. Without these beneficial microbes, plants would be severely limited in their ability to survive and reproduce in nature. However, detailed `mechanisms` explaining many beneficial plant-microbe interactions remain unclear. Therefore, my research program `combines field and lab experiments` to uncover the `mechanisms` that drive `positive relationships` among `plants`, `bacteria`, and `mycorrhizal fungi`.
